THE VISION:

MAIN IDEA: Virtual Storefront for Musicians and Other Artists i.e. Music News Reccommendation System and Advertizing Platform for Artists, Labels, and Venues
  A community of artist/label/venue profiles sourcing their preferences and information about music, the news, popular culture, brands, touring ect.
  NOTE: look at artist profiles on Reverbnation
      search filters:
    - artist name
    - genre
    - location
    - label
 
  : users should be able to search our database for an artist or a label
  and find news with targeted advertizing about various artists AND
  tour dates for those artists AND
  a map of their intented tour route AND
 
 
 
  artist profiles
  i.e. first, rock musicians, then other types of artists
     - news articles should be allowed to be organized by certain parameters
        1. By chronical order certain publication date
    i.e. from most recent to less recent
      a. by chronical order and artist ect.
      (different combinations of filters)
    2. By tour date?
    3. By type of rock e.g. Alternative, Industrial, Goth, EBM ect.

    NOTE: it is the intention of this application to expose the underground,
    therefore the popularity of the genre is irrelevant
   NOTE: news personalization i.e. analytics IS done after the basic artist / label / tour date / tour route database is built
  

KEY QUESTION :
??? But how is the information about tour dates going to be found OR extracted from the raw data that we mine? ???
     
  b. featured artist / artists page (select few evaluated by Jen)
    - link to artist website
    - link to music (SoundCloud, Spotify, YouTube)
    - link to buy music and link to tour dates
    - Map of tour route
      NOTE: tour dates AND Map of tour routes obtained
      from data mined or other API
    -  band profile
   
  c. Tour date information page
     : a more general interface for looking at tour dates
 
   c. registration system and publication/subscription system for newletter and podcast via RSS feed or other conventional mechanism
     - newsletter and podcast is advertized via a mailing system that maintains a mailing list
     - the email sent is the newletter
  
   d. links to RockThis social media presence and interfacing with social media ecosystem via APIs

administration panel:
           functions:
        a. add new video content to a video gallery / database
               b. allow for the adding of new tour dates ?
        NOTE: if data is mined and extracted what is the point?
               c. inteface for Jen's personal blog entries i.e. music features

Selecting a template:
      0. the other boxy looking magazine template
